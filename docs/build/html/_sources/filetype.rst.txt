methyl: Graph methylation file
------------------------------
The methylGrapher extraction output provides a list of each cytosine mapped to the genome graph, specified by its coordinates (segment ID, 0-based position on the segment, and strand relative to the segment).
For each cytosine, the output includes its context, the number of read-pairs supporting whether the cytosine is methylated or unmethylated, and the coverage, which is the sum of methylated and unmethylated read-pairs.
The methylation percentage is calculated as the ratio of methylated read-pairs to the total coverage.
