Toy Example
====================================

This is a toy example to show how to use the methylGrapher package to analyze the methylation data.
Also you can use it to verify the installation of the package.

All the script and data are in the `example` folder below.
https://github.com/twlab/methylGrapher/blob/main/example/




.. code-block:: shell

    git clone git@github.com:twlab/methylGrapher.git
    cd methylGrapher/example
    bash pipeline.sh

The final output will be methylGrapher/example/graph.methyl
